# Constraint Satisfaction Problem Solver

This started as a solution for the
[Exercism Zebra Problem](https://exercism.org/tracks/elixir/exercises/zebra-puzzle).
But I wanted it to be more generic, so Iâ€™ve refactored it here. I have
included some [Murdle](https://murdle.com/) problems in the tests to confirm it
is working and ensure that different styles can be solved.
