# Game of Life

A GenServer implementation of Conway's Game of Life.

**INCOMPLETE** I was toying around with an Elixir take on
https://github.com/defndaines/nijikan ... but got pulled into other things. My
next step was to look into how to use
[Erlang arrays](https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/array.html) from Elixir. I
wanted to do this for two reasons:
  1. It should be more efficient.
  1. I don't think I've used Erlang arrays before.
